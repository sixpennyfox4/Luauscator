# Luauscator

- Luauscator is a simple luau obfuscator written in nodejs.

# DISCLAIMER

- This obfuscator isnt supposed to be used for protecting scripts that you really care about as its just a side project and isnt secure and doesnt work with complex scripts. I recommend to use moonsec v3 instead.

## Requirements
- Nodejs

## How to use
- ```node main.js input.luau```
